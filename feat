Fountain of Youth

It was not long ago when a gift from the heavens was brought to the suffering lands within New Era University's (NEU) vicinity. Both the high school and elementary department received this extraordinary gift. The gift granted contentment and satisfaction to all that quenched for free potable drinking water. It provided relatively safe water that is both free of use and can be used indefinitely, features that hardly exist within NEU's premises. The fountain has cleared the drought brought to the students by both the weathers and other factors not worth mentioning. And when all is going well, good things always come to a bitter end as one day, the source of hope and free water for the high school department refused to function properly. A few days after its malfunction, it vanished without leaving any trace of its current whereabouts. Despair and astonishment daubed the NEU high school grounds. This leaves the elementary department fountain the last functional fountain of the youth.
